      <h2>Steering the Future of Undergraduate Forecasting</h2>

          >TLDR: OPTIC has built forecasting infrastructure for undergrads, but
          needs a director to move things forward and ambitiously expand. If
          you're interested in filling that role, reach out.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        OPTIC Forecasting is currently on hiatus. But we started something
        special: OPTIC built relationships with sponsors, developed tournament
        formats that work, created guides for club organizers, and established a
        network of forecasters across universities.
      </p>

      <p>
        We're passively looking for an ambitious undergraduate to take the reins
        and build something extraordinary. <b>OPTIC needs a director.</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        At first, this would involve running tournaments and starting clubs, but
        there are a variety of ideas we've had for expansion â€” and probably you
        have some too. This is about building lasting infrastructure, creating
        pathways for talented forecasters, and establishing forecasting as a
        core skill. The foundation is already laid; we just need someone with
        vision and drive to
        <a href="mailto:opticforecasting@gmail.com">build upon it</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're an undergraduate with big ideas, strong organizational skills,
        and a passion for forecasting, we want to hear from you. The resources
        are here. The network is established. If you're keen,
        <a href="mailto:opticforecasting@gmail.com">let us know</a>.
