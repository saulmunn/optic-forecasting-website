      <h2>Undergraduate Forecasting Infrastructure</h2>

      <p>
        OPTIC Forecasting builds infrastructure for undergraduate judgemental forecasting
        tournaments & clubs. It was primarily active from 2023-25, during
        which time it ran and supported forecasting more than 300 competitors at tournaments in
        Boston, the SF Bay Area, London, DC, and Providence, and helped local
        organizers start clubs at about ten universities.
      </p>
      <p>
        OPTIC was founded in early 2023 by <a href="https://saulmunn.com" target="_blank">Saul Munn</a>, Tom Shlomi, and Jingyi
        Wang, with the mentorship of Juan Gil. The organizers are now focusing
        on other projects, and as a consequence, OPTIC has been placed on an indefinite haitus (though maybe
        <a href="/director">you could change that</a>?).
